You can connect to the Mnemex API from a python script. We provide here some tutorials to show you how you can include the API in your projects.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed in your python environment

- requests
- numpy
- pandas

If you are not sure, you can double by prompting your terminal with:

```bash
pip list
```

## Installation

Create a virtual environment for this little tutorial

```bash
virtualenv mnemex
```

Then go to your new directory.

```
cd mnemex
```

Install the <requests> package,

```bash
pip install requests
```

Install pandas,

```bash
pip install pandas
```
