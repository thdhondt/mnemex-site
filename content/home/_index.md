## Goals

Our Goal with Mnemex is to facilitate data science projects built on top of cryptocurrency exchange data.

We believe that making cryptocurrency financial data open to anyone and providing an easy to use interface will promote innotvative projects. Indeed, collecting and storing financial data can be tricky and messy but it should not be a break to build your future projects.

## Why Mnemex?

Mnemex is the concatenation of Mnemosyne, the Greek word for memory, and Exchange, the cryptocurrency exchanges where we get the data from.
