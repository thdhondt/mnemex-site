Maintining and developping the database with its api enjoyable we requires us some time. As time goes by, and increasing amount of data must be stored. We would like to support new exchanges and add various pairs.

If Mnemex helps you for your projects, any donation to keep it working in the long run would be highly appreciated. To do so you can simply wire us some coins.
