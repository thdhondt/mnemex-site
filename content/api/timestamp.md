## Information

Timestamps are usefull if you plan to synchronise your computer
with our servers. You can request the timestamps in three different ways.
First, the classical or human readable timestamp. Its format is: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss. Second, the unix formatted timestamp is accessible. For more information please visit the following link. Finally, the millisecond unix timestamp. Any historical data returned by the API will have a millisecond unix timestamp. We chose that one for the sake of simplicity.
